1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Proof (JWP) [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof] draft
   establishes a new secure container format that supports selective
   disclosure and unlinkability using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or
   other cryptographic algorithms.

   |  Editor's Note: This draft is still early and incomplete.  There
   |  will be significant changes to the algorithms as currently defined
   |  here.  Please do not use any of these definitions or examples for
   |  anything except personal experimentation and learning.
   |  Contributions and feedback are welcomed at https://github.com/
   |  json-web-proofs/json-web-proofs (https://github.com/json-web-
   |  proofs/json-web-proofs).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The roles of "issuer", "holder", and "verifier" are used as defined
   by the VC Data Model [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0].  The term "presentation" is
   also used as defined by this source, but the term "credential" is
   avoided in this specification to minimize confusion with other
   definitions.

3.  Terminology

   The terms "JSON Web Signature (JWS)", "Base64url Encoding", "Header
   Parameter", "JOSE Header", "JWS Payload", "JWS Signature", and "JWS
   Protected Header" are defined by [RFC7515].

   The terms "JSON Web Proof (JWP)", "JWP Payload", "JWP Proof", and
   "JWP Protected Header" are defined by [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof].

   These terms are defined by this specification:

   Stable Key:  An asymmetric key-pair used by an issuer that is also
      shared via an out-of-band mechanism to a verifier to validate the
      signature.
   Ephemeral Key:  An asymmetric key-pair that is generated for one-time
      use by an issuer and never stored or used again outside of the
      creation of a single JWP.
   Presentation Key:  An asymmetric key-pair that is generated by a
      holder and used to ensure that a presentation is not able to be
      replayed by any other party.

4.  Background

   JWP defines a container binding together a protected header, one or
   more payloads, and a cryptographic proof.  It does not define any
   details about the interactions between an application and the
   cryptographic libraries that implement proof-supporting algorithms.

   Due to the nature of ZKPs, this specification also documents the
   subtle but important differences in proof algorithms versus those
   defined by the JSON Web Algorithms [RFC7518].  These differences help
   support more advanced capabilities such as blinded signatures and
   predicate proofs.

5.  Algorithm Basics

   The four principal interactions that every proof algorithm MUST
   support are [issue](#issue), [confirm](#confirm),
   [present](#present), and [verify](#verify).

5.1.  Issue

   The JWP is first created as the output of a JPA's issue operation.

   Every algorithm MUST support a JSON issuer protected header along
   with one or more octet string payloads.  The algorithm MAY support
   using additional items provided by the holder for issuance such as
   blinded payloads, keys for replay prevention, etc.

   All algorithms MUST provide integrity protection for the issuer
   header and all payloads and MUST specify all digest and/or hash2curve
   methods used.

5.2.  Confirm

   Performed by the holder to validate that the issued JWP is correctly
   formed and protected.

   Each algorithm MAY support using additional input items options, such
   as those sent to the issuer for issuance.  After confirmation, an
   algorithm MAY return a modified JWP for serialized storage without
   the local state (such as with blinded payloads now unblinded).

   The algorithm MUST fully verify the issued proof value against the
   issuer protected header and all payloads.  If given a presented JWP
   instead of an issued one, the confirm process MUST return an error.

5.3.  Present

   Used to apply any selective disclosure choices and perform any
   unlinkability transformations, as well as to show binding.

   An algorithm MAY support additional input options from the requesting
   party, such as for predicate proofs and verifiable computation
   requests.

   Every algorithm MUST support the ability to hide any or all payloads.
   It MUST always include the issuer protected header unmodified in the
   presentation.

   The algorithm MUST replace the issued proof value and generate a new
   presented proof value.  It also MUST include a new presentation
   protected header that provides replay protection.

5.4.  Verify

   Performed by the verifier to verify the protected headers along with
   any disclosed payloads and/or assertions about them from the proving
   party, while also verifying they are the same payloads and ordering
   as witnessed by the issuer.

   The algorithm MUST verify the integrity of all disclosed payloads and
   MUST also verify the integrity of both the issuer and presentation
   protected headers.

   If the presented proof contains any assertions about the hidden
   payloads, the algorithm MUST also verify all of those assertions.  It
   MAY support additional options, such as those sent to the holder to
   generate the presentation.

   If given an issued JWP for verification, the algorithm MUST return an
   error.

6.  Algorithm Specifications

   This section defines how to use specific algorithms for JWPs.

6.1.  Single Use

   |  Editor's Note: This algorithm may be renamed and slightly
   |  refactored.

   The Single Use (SU) algorithm is based on composing multiple
   traditional JWS values into a JWP proof.  It enables a very simple
   form of selective disclosure without requiring any advanced
   cryptographic techniques.

   It does not support unlinkability if the same JWP is presented
   multiple times, therefore when privacy is required the holder will
   need to interact with the issuer again to receive new single-use JWPs
   (dynamically or in batches).

6.1.1.  JWS Algorithm

   The Single Use algorithm is based on using multiple JWS values, all
   of which are generated with the same JSON Web Algorithm (JWA) for
   signing.  This JWA identifier is included as part of the Single Use
   identifier for JWP.

   The chosen JWA MUST be an asymmetric signing algorithm so that each
   signature can be verified without sharing any private values between
   the parties.  This ensures that the verifier cannot brute force any
   non-disclosed payloads based only on their disclosed individual
   signatures.

6.1.2.  Holder Setup

   In order to support the protection of a presentation by a holder to a
   verifier, the holder MUST use a Presentation Key during the issuance
   and the presentation of every Single Use JWP.  This Presentation Key
   MUST be generated and used for only one JWP.

   The issuer MUST verify that the holder has possession of this key.
   The holder-issuer communication to exchange this information is out
   of scope of this specification but can be easily accomplished by the
   holder using this key to generate a JWS that signs a value the issuer
   can verify as unique.

6.1.3.  Issuer Setup

   To create a Single Use JWP, the issuer first generates a unique
   Ephemeral Key using the selected JWS algorithm.  This key-pair will
   be used to sign each of the payloads of a single JWP and then
   discarded.

6.1.4.  Using JWS

   JSON Web Signatures are used to create all of the signature values
   used by the SU algorithm.  This allows an implementation to use an
   existing JWS library directly for all necessary cryptographic
   operations without requiring any additional primitives.

   Each individual JWS uses a fixed protected header containing only the
   minimum required alg value.  Since this JWS protected header itself
   is the same for every JWS, it SHOULD be a static value in the form of
   {"alg":"***"} where *** is the JWA asymmetric signing key algorithm
   identifier being used.  This value is recreated by a verifier using
   the correct JWA algorithm value included in the SU algorithm
   identifier.

   If an implementation uses an alternative JWS protected header than
   this fixed value, a base64url encoded serialized form of the
   alternate fixed header MUST be included using the jws_header claim in
   the issuer protected header.

6.1.5.  Issuer Protected Header

   The JWK of the issuer's Ephemeral Key MUST be included in the issuer
   protected header with the property name of proof_jwk and contain only
   the REQUIRED values to represent the public key.

   The holder's Presentation Key JWK MUST be included in issuer
   protected header using the presentation_jwk claim.

   The final issuer protected header is then used directly as the body
   of a JWS and signed using the issuer's Stable Key.  The resulting JWS
   signature value unencoded octet string is the first value in the JWP
   proof.

   In various examples in this specification, the octet string
   serialized issuer header is referenced as issuer_header.

6.1.6.  Payloads

   Each JWP payload is processed in order and signed as a JWS body using
   the issuer's Ephemeral Key.  The resulting JWS signature value
   unencoded octet string is appended to the JWP proof.

6.1.7.  Proof

   The proof value is an octet string array.  The first entry is the
   unencoded signature of the issuer protected header, with each
   additional entry being a unencoded ephemeral key signature of an
   issued payload.

6.1.8.  Presentation Protected Header

   To generate a new presentation, the holder first creates a
   presentation protected header that is specific to the verifier being
   presented to.  This header MUST contain a claim that both the holder
   and verifier trust as being unique and non-replayable.  Use of the
   nonce header parameter is RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

   This specification registers the nonce header parameter for the
   presentation protected header that contains a string value either
   generated by the verifier or derived from values provided by the
   verifier.  When present, the verifier MUST ensure the nonce value
   matches during verification.

   The presentation protected header MAY contain other header parameters
   that are either provided by the verifier or by the holder.  These
   presentation claims SHOULD NOT contain values that are common across
   multiple presentations and SHOULD be unique to a single presentation
   and verifier.

   In various examples in this specification, the octet string
   serialized presentation header is referenced as presentation_header.

6.1.9.  Presentation

   |  Editor's Note: The current definition here is incomplete, the
   |  holder's signature needs to also incorporate the presented proof.

   The holder derives a new proof array of octets when presenting it to
   a verifier.  The presented proof value will always contain the
   issuer's Stable Key signature for the issuer protected header as the
   first element.

   The second element of the presented proof is the holder's signature
   of the presentation protected header using the holder's presentation
   key.  This signature is constructed using the same technique
   desscribed for generating the issuer's signature over the issuer
   protected header.  Signing only the presentation header with the
   Presentation Key is sufficient to protect the entire presentation
   since that key is private to the holder and only the contents of the
   presentation header are used for replay prevention.

   The two header signatures are then followed by only the issuer's
   Ephemeral Key signatures for each payload that is disclosed.  The
   order of the payload signatures is preserved and MUST be in the same
   order as the included disclosed payloads in the presented JWP.  Non-
   disclosed payloads will NOT have a signature value included.

   For example, if the second and fifth of five payloads are not
   disclosed, then the holder's derived proof would consist of the
   issuer's signature over the issuer protected header, the holder's
   signature over the holder's protected header, the ephemeral key
   signature over the first, third and fourth payloads.

   Since the individual signatures in the proof value are unique and
   remain unchanged across multiple presentations, a Single Use JWP
   SHOULD only be presented a single time to each verifier in order for
   the holder to remain unlinkable across multiple presentations.

6.1.10.  Verification

   The verifier MUST verify the issuer protected header against the
   first matching JWS signature part in the proof using the issuer's
   Stable Key.  It MUST also verify the presentation protected header
   against the second part in the proof value using the holder's
   Presentation Key as provided in the presentation_jwk claim in the
   issuer protected header.

   With the headers verified, the issuer's Ephemeral Key as given in the
   issuer protected header proof_jwk claim can then be used to verify
   each of the disclosed payload signatures.

6.1.11.  JPA Registration

   The proposed JWP alg value is of the format "SU-" appended with the
   relevant JWS alg value for the chosen public and ephemeral key-pair
   algorithm, for example "SU-ES256".

6.2.  BBS

   The BBS Signature Scheme [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] is under
   active development within the CRFG.

   This algorithm supports both selective disclosure and unlinkability,
   enabling the holder to generate multiple presentations from one
   issued JWP without a verifier being able to correlate those
   presentations together based on the proof.

6.2.1.  JPA Algorithms

   The BBS alg parameter value in the issuance protected header
   corresponds to a ciphersuite identifier of BBS_BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-
   256_SSWU_RO_.

   The BBS-PROOF alg parameter value in the presentation protected
   header corresponds to the same ciphersuite, but used in presentation
   form.

6.2.2.  Key Format

   The key used for the BBS algorithm is an elliptic curve-based key
   pair, specifically against the G_2 subgroup of a pairing friendly
   curve.  Additional details on key generation can be found in
   Section 3.4

   The JWK form of this key is an OKP type with a curve of BLS12381G2,
   with x being the BASE64URL-encoded form of the output of
   point_to_octets_E2.  The use of this curve is described in
   [I-D.ietf-cose-bls-key-representations].

   There is no additional holder key necessary for presentation proofs.

6.2.3.  Issuance

   Issuance is performed using the Sign operation from Section 3.5.1 of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].  This operation utilizes the issuer's
   BLS12-381 G2 key pair as SK and PK, along with desired protected
   header and payloads as the octets header and the octets array
   messages.

   The octets resulting from this operation form a single octet string
   in the issuance proof array, to be used along with the protected
   header and payloads to serialize the JWP.

6.2.4.  Issuance Proof Verification

   Holder verification of the signature on issuance form is performed
   using the Verify operation from Section 3.5.2 of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the proof as
   signature, the protected header octets as header and the array of
   payload octets as messages.

6.2.5.  Presentation

   Derivation of a presentation is done by the holder using the ProofGen
   operation from Section 3.5.3 of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the issuer
   protected header as header, the issuance proof as signature, the
   issuance payloads as messages, and the holder's presentation
   protected header as ph.

   The operation also takes a vector of indexes into messages,
   describing which payloads the holder wishes to disclose.  All
   payloads are required for proof generation, but only these indicated
   payloads will be required to be disclosed for later proof
   verification.

   The output of this operation is the presentation proof, as a single
   octet string.

   Presentation serialization leverages the two protected headers and
   presentation proof, along with the disclosed payloads.  Non-disclosed
   payloads are represented with the absent value of null in JSON
   serialization and a zero-length string in compact serialization.

6.2.6.  Presentation Verification

   Verification of a presentation is done by the verifier using the
   ProofVerify operation from Section 3.5.4.

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the issuer
   protected header as header, the issuance proof as signature, the
   holder's presentation protected header as ph, and the payloads as
   disclosed_messages.

   In addition, the disclosed_indexes scalar array is calculated from
   the payloads provided.  Values disclosed in the presented payloads
   have a zero-based index in this array, while the indices of absent
   payloads are omitted.

6.3.  Message Authentication Code

   The Message Authentication Code (MAC) JPA uses a MAC to both generate
   ephemeral keys and compute authentication codes to protect the issuer
   header and each payload individually.

   Like the JWS-based JPA, it also does not support unlinkability if the
   same JWP is presented multiple times and requires an individually
   issued JWP for each presentation in order to fully protect privacy.
   When compared to the JWS approach, using a MAC requires less
   computation but can result in potentially larger presentation proof
   values.

   The design is intentionally minimal and only involves using a single
   standardized MAC method instead of a mix of MAC/hash methods or a
   custom hash-based construct.  It is able to use any published
   cryptographic MAC method such as HMAC [RFC2104] or KMAC
   (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/
   NIST.SP.800-185.pdf).  It uses traditional public-key based
   signatures to verify the authenticity of the issuer and holder.

6.3.1.  Holder Setup

   Prior to the issuer creating a new JWP, it must have presentation
   binding information provided by the holder.  This enables the holder
   to perform replay prevention while presenting the JWP.

   The presentation key used by the holder must be transferred to the
   issuer and verified, likely through a challenge and self-signing
   mechanism.  If the holder requires unlinkability, it must also
   generate a new key that is verified and bound to each new JWP.

   How these holder presentation keys are transferred and verified is
   out of scope of this specification.  Protocols such as OpenID Connect
   can be used to accomplish this.  What is required by this definition
   is that the holder's presentation key MUST be included in the
   issuer's protected header using the pjwk claim with a JWK as the
   value.

6.3.2.  Issuer Setup

   To use the MAC algorithm, the issuer must have a stable public key
   pair to perform signing.  To start the issuance process, a single
   32-byte random Shared Secret must first be generated.  This value
   will be shared privately to the holder as part of the issuer's JWP
   proof value.

   The Shared Secret is used by both the issuer and holder as the MAC
   method's key to generate a new set of unique ephemeral keys.  These
   keys are then used as the input to generate a MAC that protects each
   payload.

6.3.3.  Issuer Protected Header

   The holder's presentation key JWK MUST be included in the issuer
   protected header using the pjwk claim.  The issuer MUST validate that
   the holder has possession of this key through a trusted mechanism
   such as verifying the signature of a unique nonce value from the
   holder.

6.3.4.  Combined MAC Representation

   The combined MAC representation is a single octet string representing
   the MAC values of the issuer protected header, along with each
   payload provided by the issuer.  This representation is signed by the
   issuer, but not shared - parties will recreate this octet string and
   verify the signature to verify the integrity of supplied issuer
   protected header and the integrity of any disclosed payloads.

   The issuer protected header is included in this value as a MAC
   created using the fixed key "issuer_header" in UTF-8 encoded octets.
   The value is the issuer header JSON in its base64url-encoded form, as
   a UTF-8 encoded octet string.

   A unique key is generated for each payload using a MAC, with the
   Shared Secret as the key and a value of "payload_X" as UTF-8 encoded
   octets, where "X" is replaced by the zero-based array index of the
   payload, for example "payload_0", "payload_1", etc.

   Each payload then itself has a corresponding MAC, using the above
   per-payload key and the payload in its base64url-encoded form, sa a
   UTF-8 encoded octet string.

   The combined MAC representation is the octet string formed by the the
   concatentation of the issuer protected header MAC output, along with
   each payload MAC output.

6.3.5.  Issuer Proof

   The issuer proof consists of two octet strings.

   The first octet string is the issuer signature over the combined mac
   representation.  The issuer signs the JWS using its stable public
   key, and a fixed header containing the alg associated with signing
   algorithm in use.

   jws_header = '{"alg":"ES256"}'

   The signature value of the JWS is extracted and base64url-decoded
   into an octet string.

   The second octet string is the Shared Secret used to generate the
   per-payload keys for the combined representation.

6.3.6.  Presentation Protected Header

   See the JWS Presentation Protected Header (#presentation-protected-
   header) section.

6.3.7.  Presentation Proof

   |  Editor's Note: The current definition here is incomplete, the
   |  holder's signature needs to also incorporate the presented proof.

   The first value in the presentation proof is the presentation
   signature.  This is a signature over the presentation protected
   header, using the key specified by the pjwk parameter in the issuer
   protected header.

   The second value is the issuer signature over the Combined MAC
   Representation provided with the issued form.

   The remaining values are used by the verifier to reconstruct the
   combined MAC representation without access to the Shared Secret.
   There is one value corresponding to each payload, whether it has been
   disclosed or not.

   If a payload is disclosed, the unique per-payload key derived from
   the shared secret is used as the payload's entry in the proof array.

   If a payload is not disclosed, the payload's MAC in the combined MAC
   representation is used as the payload's entry in the proof array.

6.3.8.  Verification of the Presentation Proof

   The verifier must recreate the Combined MAC Representation from the
   presentation proof to verify integrity over the disclosed
   information.

   The issuer protected header MAC is recreated using the same mechanism
   described above.

   For each payload in the presentation:

   *  If the payload is disclosed, then the presentation proof contains
      the unique per-payload key.  The corresponding payload MAC can be
      computed by performing the MAC operation with this key and the
      corresponding payload.

   *  If the payload is not disclosed, then the presentation proof
      contains the payload MAC, which can be used directly

   The concatenation of the octets of the issuer protected header MAC
   and each payload MAC forms the Combined MAC Representation.  The
   issuer signature in the proof is then verified by converting these
   values to a JWS as described above, and verifying that JWS.

6.3.9.  JPA Registration

   Proposed JWP alg value is of the format "MAC-" appended with a unique
   identifier for the set of MAC and signing algorithms used.  Below are
   the initial registrations:

   *  MAC-H256 uses HMAC SHA-256 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-256 and
      SHA-256 for the signatures
   *  MAC-H384 uses HMAC SHA-384 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-384 and
      SHA-384 for the signatures
   *  MAC-H512 uses HMAC SHA-512 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-521 and
      SHA-512 for the signatures
   *  MAC-K25519 uses KMAC SHAKE128 as the MAC and EdDSA using
      Curve25519 for the signatures
   *  MAC-K448 uses KMAC SHAKE256 as the MAC and EdDSA using Curve448
      for the signatures
   *  MAC-H256K uses HMAC SHA-256 as the MAC and ECDSA using secp256k1
      and SHA-256 for the signatures

7.  Security Considerations

   |  Editor's Note: This will follow once the algorithms defined here
   |  have become more stable.

   *  Data minimization of the proof value
   *  Unlinkability of the protected header contents

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the jose-reg-review@ietf.org
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register JWP algorithm:
   example").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
   description is clear.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

8.1.  JSON Web Proof Algorithms Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "JSON Web Proof Algorithms"
   registry for values of the JWP alg (algorithm) parameter in JWP
   Header Parameters.  The registry records the algorithm name, the
   algorithm description, the algorithm usage locations, the
   implementation requirements, the change controller, and a reference
   to the specification that defines it.  The same algorithm name can be
   registered multiple times, provided that the sets of usage locations
   are disjoint.

   It is suggested that the length of the key be included in the
   algorithm name when multiple variations of algorithms are being
   registered that use keys of different lengths and the key lengths for
   each need to be fixed (for instance, because they will be created by
   key derivation functions).  This allows readers of the JSON text to
   more easily make security decisions.

   The Designated Experts should perform reasonable due diligence that
   algorithms being registered either are currently considered
   cryptographically credible or are being registered as Deprecated or
   Prohibited.

   The implementation requirements of an algorithm may be changed over
   time as the cryptographic landscape evolves, for instance, to change
   the status of an algorithm to Deprecated or to change the status of
   an algorithm from Optional to Recommended+ or Required.  Changes of
   implementation requirements are only permitted on a Specification
   Required basis after review by the Designated Experts, with the new
   specification defining the revised implementation requirements level.

8.1.1.  Registration Template

   *  Algorithm Name: The name requested (e.g., "SU-ES256").  This name
      is a case-sensitive ASCII string.  Names may not match other
      registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the
      Designated Experts state that there is a compelling reason to
      allow an exception.
   *  Algorithm Description: Brief description of the algorithm (e.g.,
      "Single-Use JWP using ES256").
   *  Algorithm Usage Location(s): The algorithm usage locations, which
      should be one or more of the values Issued or Presented.  Other
      values may be used with the approval of a Designated Expert.
   *  JWP Implementation Requirements: The algorithm implementation
      requirements for JWP, which must be one the words Required,
      Recommended, Optional, Deprecated, or Prohibited.  Optionally, the
      word can be followed by a "+" or "-".  The use of "+" indicates
      that the requirement strength is likely to be increased in a
      future version of the specification.  The use of "-" indicates
      that the requirement strength is likely to be decreased in a
      future version of the specification.  Any identifiers registered
      for non-authenticated encryption algorithms or other algorithms
      that are otherwise unsuitable for direct use as JWP algorithms
      must be registered as "Prohibited".
   *  Change Controller: For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, email address, home page URI) may also be
      included.
   *  Specification Document(s): Reference to the document or documents
      that specify the parameter, preferably including URIs that can be
      used to retrieve copies of the documents.  An indication of the
      relevant sections may also be included but is not required.
   *  Algorithm Analysis Documents(s): References to a publication or
      publications in well-known cryptographic conferences, by national
      standards bodies, or by other authoritative sources analyzing the
      cryptographic soundness of the algorithm to be registered.  The
      Designated Experts may require convincing evidence of the
      cryptographic soundness of a new algorithm to be provided with the
      registration request unless the algorithm is being registered as
      Deprecated or Prohibited.  Having gone through working group and
      IETF review, the initial registrations made by this document are
      exempt from the need to provide this information.

Appendix A.  Example JWPs

   The following examples use algorithms defined in JSON Proof
   Algorithms and also contain the keys used, so that implementations
   can validate these samples.

A.1.  Example Single-Use JWP

   This example uses the Single-Use Algorithm as defined in JSON Proof
   Algorithms to create a JSON Proof Token.  It demonstrates how to
   apply selective disclosure using an array of traditional JWS-based
   signatures.  Unlinkability is only achieved by using each JWP one
   time, as multiple uses are inherently linkable via the traditional
   ECDSA signature embedded in the proof.

   To begin, we need two asymmetric keys for Single Use: one that
   represents the JPT Issuer's stable key and the other is an ephemeral
   key generated by the Issuer just for this JWP.

   This is the Issuer's stable private key used in this example in the
   JWK format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "Sv7tLk56KpfVxQ5jyx1uZtr49bFT6cd6riKG60yyIEg",
     "y": "_vLxKFbMmSKiWY3kDsP09KcM3iuCdEja6cW36HzLqQM",
     "d": "H32eIZLmBBhBXbrxCQe9zxPNUW9X_6iy8_yk_As7AO0"
   }

                    Figure 1: Issuer Private Key (es256)

   This is the ephemeral private key used in this example in the JWK
   format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "Ub0vxwLV-7x0-ikxDQw57k5cuaFsNYKK2NzcCBWJSkA",

   }

               Figure 2: Issuer Ephemeral Private Key (es256)

   This is the Holder's presentation private key used in this example in
   the JWK format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "UxQoT3-kXb4yJC2zvNSR8UDkCQmQ6EMLoJaJi3a0ie8",

     "d": "I1_AgUr2s93C8anp0BIeiYjrTCLhbDPFPQEIUiBvV2U"
   }

                 Figure 3: Holder Presentation Private Key

   The JWP Protected Header declares that the data structure is a JPT
   and the JWP Proof Input is secured using the Single-Use ECDSA
   algorithm with the P-256 curve and SHA-256 digest.  It also includes
   the ephemeral public key, the Holder's presentation public key and
   list of claims used for this JPT.

   The JWP Protected Header is serialized (without the above whitespace
   added for readability) into UTF-8, then BASE64URL-encoded.  This

             Figure 5: Encoded Issuer Protected Header (es256)

   The Single Use algorithm utilizes multiple individual JWS Signatures.
   Each signature value is generated by creating a JWS with a single
   Protected Header with the associated alg value.  In this example, the
   fixed header used for each JWS is the serialized JSON Object
   {"alg":"ES256"}. This protected header will be used to generate a
   signature over each corresponding payload in the JWP.  The
   corresponding octet value in the proof is the binary (base64url-
   decoded) value of the signature.

   The final proof value from the Issuer is an array with the octets of
   the header signature, followed by entries for each payload signature.

   The resulting JSON serialized JPT using the above examples is:

           Figure 7: Issued JWP in Compact Serialization (es256)

   To present this JPT, we first use the following presentation header
   with a nonce (provided by the Verifier):

   {
     "alg": "SU-ES256",
     "aud": "https://recipient.example.com",
     "nonce": "wAfIDxbgY5gJd6ez1yl9p8txGhoVliRQsgZlS5KYE_M"
   }

                       Figure 8: Presentation Header

   When serialized without formatting and BASE64URL-encoded, this
   results in the string:

   eyJhbGciOiJTVS1FUzI1NiIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcmVjaXBpZW50LmV4YW1wbGUuY

   tZRV9NIn0

             Figure 9: Presentation Header (BASE64URL-encoded)

   When signed with the holder's presentation key, the resulting
   signature are:

   c3hVODNWVHpuaTJ4eFJxQ01lN3ZnYjJKTWlGUmQ0d3gxVkV1NV9TMWV5cUlxeU41d2JZS

   Then by applying selective disclosure of only the given name and age

   The first MAC is generated using the key issuer_header and the
   base64url-encoded issuer protected header, resulting in the following
   base64url-encoded octet array:

   The issuer generates an array of derived keys with one for each
   payload by using the shared secret as the key, and the index of the
   payload (as payload_{n} in UTF-8 encoded octets) as the input in a
   HMAC operation.  This results in the following set of derived keys
   (as base64url-encoded members in a JSON array):

   Next, we show the presentation of the JWP with selective disclosure.

   For presentation with the following presentation protected header:

   {
     "alg": "MAC-H256",
     "aud": "https://recipient.example.com",
     "nonce": "wAfIDxbgY5gJd6ez1yl9p8txGhoVliRQsgZlS5KYE_M"
   }

                  Figure 29: Presentation Protected Header

   The holder will take the issuer proof (including shared secret) and
   derive the same individual payload MAC values (above).

   In this case, the holder has decided not to disclose the last three
   claims provided by the issuer (corresponding to email, address, and
   age_over_21)

   For the disclosed payloads, the holder will provide the corresponding
   derived key.  For the non-disclosed payloads, the holder will provide
   the corresponding MAC value.

   The final presented proof value is generated by concatenating first
   the presentation header signature octet string, followed by the
   issuer signature octet string, then the value disclosed by the holder
   for each payload.  This results in the following proof, represented
   as a JSON array of base64url-encoded values:
