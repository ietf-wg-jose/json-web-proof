1.  Introduction

   The JSON Web Proof (JWP) [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof] draft
   establishes a new secure container format that supports selective
   disclosure and unlinkability using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or
   other cryptographic algorithms.

   |  Editor's Note: This draft is still early and incomplete.  There
   |  will be significant changes to the algorithms as currently defined
   |  here.  Please do not use any of these definitions or examples for
   |  anything except personal experimentation and learning.
   |  Contributions and feedback are welcomed at https://github.com/
   |  ietf-wg-jose/json-web-proof (https://github.com/ietf-wg-jose/json-
   |  web-proof).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The roles of "issuer", "holder", and "verifier" are used as defined
   by the VC Data Model [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0].  The term "presentation" is
   also used as defined by this source, but the term "credential" is
   avoided in this specification to minimize confusion with other
   definitions.

3.  Terminology

   The terms "JSON Web Signature (JWS)", "Base64url Encoding", "Header
   Parameter", "JOSE Header", "JWS Payload", "JWS Signature", and "JWS
   Protected Header" are defined by [RFC7515].

   The terms "JSON Web Proof (JWP)", "JWP Payload", "JWP Proof", and
   "JWP Protected Header" are defined by [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof].

   These terms are defined by this specification:

   Stable Key:  An asymmetric key-pair used by an issuer that is also
      shared via an out-of-band mechanism to a verifier to validate the
      signature.
   Issuer Ephemeral Key:  An asymmetric key-pair that is generated for
      one-time use by an issuer and never stored or used again outside
      of the creation of a single JWP.
   Holder Presentation Key:  An asymmetric key-pair that is generated by
      a holder and used to ensure that a presentation is not able to be
      replayed by any other party.

4.  Background

   JWP defines a container binding together a protected header, one or
   more payloads, and a cryptographic proof.  It does not define any
   details about the interactions between an application and the
   cryptographic libraries that implement proof-supporting algorithms.

   Due to the nature of ZKPs, this specification also documents the
   subtle but important differences in proof algorithms versus those
   defined by the JSON Web Algorithms [RFC7518].  These differences help
   support more advanced capabilities such as blinded signatures and
   predicate proofs.

5.  Algorithm Basics

   The four principal interactions that every proof algorithm MUST
   support are issue (#issue), confirm (#confirm), present (#present),
   and verify (#verify).

5.1.  Issue

   The JWP is first created as the output of a JPA's issue operation.

   Every algorithm MUST support a JSON issuer protected header along
   with one or more octet string payloads.  The algorithm MAY support
   using additional items provided by the holder for issuance such as
   blinded payloads, keys for replay prevention, etc.

   All algorithms MUST provide integrity protection for the issuer
   header and all payloads and MUST specify all digest and/or hash2curve
   methods used.

5.2.  Confirm

   Performed by the holder to validate that the issued JWP is correctly
   formed and protected.

   Each algorithm MAY support using additional input items options, such
   as those sent to the issuer for issuance.  After confirmation, an
   algorithm MAY return a modified JWP for serialized storage without
   the local state (such as with blinded payloads now unblinded).

   The algorithm MUST fully verify the issued proof value against the
   issuer protected header and all payloads.  If given a presented JWP
   instead of an issued one, the confirm process MUST return an error.

5.3.  Present

   Used to apply any selective disclosure choices and perform any
   unlinkability transformations, as well as to show binding.

   An algorithm MAY support additional input options from the requesting
   party, such as for predicate proofs and verifiable computation
   requests.

   Every algorithm MUST support the ability to hide any or all payloads.
   It MUST always include the issuer protected header unmodified in the
   presentation.

   The algorithm MUST replace the issued proof value and generate a new
   presented proof value.  It also MUST include a new presentation
   protected header that provides replay protection.

5.4.  Verify

   Performed by the verifier to verify the protected headers along with
   any disclosed payloads and/or assertions about them from the proving
   party, while also verifying they are the same payloads and ordering
   as witnessed by the issuer.

   The algorithm MUST verify the integrity of all disclosed payloads and
   MUST also verify the integrity of both the issuer and presentation
   protected headers.

   If the presented proof contains any assertions about the hidden
   payloads, the algorithm MUST also verify all of those assertions.  It
   MAY support additional options, such as those sent to the holder to
   generate the presentation.

   If given an issued JWP for verification, the algorithm MUST return an
   error.

6.  Algorithm Specifications

   This section defines how to use specific algorithms for JWPs.

6.1.  Single Use

   The Single Use (SU) algorithm is based on composing multiple
   traditional asymmetric signatures into a single JWP proof.  It
   enables a very simple form of selective disclosure without requiring
   any advanced cryptographic techniques.

   It does not support unlinkability if the same JWP is presented
   multiple times, therefore when privacy is required the holder will
   need to interact with the issuer again to receive new single-use JWPs
   (dynamically or in batches).

6.1.1.  JWS Algorithm

   The Single Use algorithm uses multiple signing keys to protect the
   protected header as well as individual payloads of an Issued JWP.
   The issuer uses a stable public key to sign each protected header,
   and a per-JWP ephemeral key (conveyed within the protected header) to
   protect the individual payloads.  These signatures are all created
   using the same Asymmetric Algorithm, with the JOSE and COSE name/
   label of this algorithm being part of registration for a fully-
   specified Single Use algorithm identifier.

   The issuer protected header also conveys a holder presentation key,
   an ephemeral asymmetric key meant to only be used for presenting a
   single JWP.  The fully-specified algorithm the holder must use for
   presentations is also included.  This algorithm MAY be different from
   the algorithm used by the issuer.

   The chosen algorithms MUST be asymmetric signing algorithms, so that
   each signature can be verified without sharing any private values
   between the parties.

6.1.2.  Holder Setup

   In order to support the protection of a presentation by a holder to a
   verifier, the holder MUST use a Holder Presentation Key during the
   issuance and the presentation of every Single Use JWP.  This Holder
   Presentation Key MUST be generated and used for only one JWP if
   unlinkability is desired.

   The issuer MUST verify that the holder has possession of this key.
   The holder-issuer communication to exchange this information is out
   of scope of this specification, but can be accomplished by the holder
   using this key to generate a JWS that signs a value the issuer can
   verify as unique.

   The issuer MUST determine an appropriate holder presentation
   algorithm corresponding to the holder presentation key.  If the
   holder and verifier cannot be assumed to know this algorithm is the
   appropriate choice for a given holder presentation key, this value
   MUST be conveyed in the hpa issuer protected header.

6.1.3.  Issuer Setup

   To create a Single Use JWP, the issuer first generates a unique
   Ephemeral Key using the selected internal algorithm.  This key-pair
   will be used to sign each of the payloads of a single JWP and then
   discarded.

6.1.4.  Signing Payloads

   Each individual payload is signed using the selected internal
   algorithm using the Ephemeral Key.

6.1.5.  Issuer Protected Header

   The Issuer's Ephemeral Key MUST be included via the Issuer Ephemeral
   Key header parameter.

   The Holder's Presentation Key MUST be included via the Holder
   Presentation Key header parameter.

   The Holder's Presentation Algorithm MUST be included via the Holder
   Presentation Algorithm header parameter unless there is another way
   for the holder and verifier to unambiguously determine the
   appropriate algorithm to use.

   The Issuer Protected Header is signed using the appropriate internal
   signing algorithm for the given fully-specified single use algorithm,
   using the issuer's Stable Key.

6.1.6.  Payloads

   Each JWP payload is processed in order and signed using the given JWA
   using the issuer's Ephemeral Key.

6.1.7.  Proof

   The proof value is an octet string array.  The first entry is the
   octet string of the issuer protected header signature, with an
   additional entry for each payload signature.

6.1.8.  Presentation Protected Header #{presentation-protected-header}

   To generate a new presentation, the holder first creates a
   presentation protected header that is specific to the verifier being
   presented to.  This header MUST contain a parameter that both the
   holder and verifier trust as being unique and non-replayable.  Use of
   the nonce header parameter is RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

   This specification registers the nonce header parameter for the
   presentation protected header that contains a string value either
   generated by the verifier or derived from values provided by the
   verifier.  When present, the verifier MUST ensure the nonce value
   matches during verification.

   The presentation protected header MAY contain other header parameters
   that are either provided by the verifier or by the holder.  These
   presentation header parameters SHOULD NOT contain values that are
   common across multiple presentations and SHOULD be unique to a single
   presentation and verifier.

   The presentation protected header MUST contain the same Algorithm
   protected header as the issuer protected header.  The Holder
   Presentation Algorithm protected header MUST NOT be included.

6.1.9.  Presentation

   The holder derives a new proof as part of presentation.  The holder
   will also use these components to generate a presentation internal
   representation (#presentation-internal-representation).  The number
   of components depends on the number of payloads which are being
   disclosed in the presented JWP.

   The first proof component will be the signature over the issuer
   protected header made by the issuer's Stable Key.

   For each payload which is to be disclosed, the corresponding payload
   signature (from the issued JWP) is included as a subsequent proof
   component.  If the payload is being omitted, the corresponding
   payload signature is omitted from the proof components.

   The holder protected header, issuer protected header, payload slots
   (distinguishing which are being disclosed) and these proof components
   are inputs to determine the presentation internal representation.

   The holder's signature over the presentation internal representation
   (using the holder's private key and the holder presentation
   algorithm) is then included as one additional proof component in the
   final presentation.

   For example, if only the second and fifth of five payloads are being
   disclosed, then the proof at this stage will consist of three values:

   1.  The issuer's signature over the issuer protected header
   2.  The payload signature corresponding to the second payload
   3.  The payload signature corresponding to the fifth payload.

   The presentation internal representation would be calculated with
   these three proof components, while the final presentation would have
   an additional fourth component containing the signature using the
   holder's private key.

   Since the individual signatures in the proof value are unique and
   remain unchanged across multiple presentations, a Single Use JWP
   SHOULD only be presented a single time to each verifier in order for
   the holder to remain unlinkable across multiple presentations.

6.1.10.  Verification of Presentation

   Verification is performed using the following steps.

   1.  Check that the number of proof components is appropriate for the
       number of disclosed payloads.  There MUST be two more proof
       components than disclosed payloads.
   2.  Verify the first proof component is a valid signature over issuer
       protected header octets, using the issuer's stable key.
   3.  Extract the holder presentation key and holder presentation
       algorithm (if present) from the issuer protected header.
   4.  Omitting the final payload component, calculate the presentation
       internal representation (#presentation-internal-representation).
   5.  Verify the final proof component is a valid signature over the
       presentation internal binary form, using the holder's
       presentation key and the extracted (or otherwise determined)
       holder presentation algorithm.
   6.  For each remaining proof component, verify they form a valid
       signature over each disclosed payload in sequence, using the
       issuer's ephemeral key.

6.1.11.  JPA Registration

   The proposed JWP alg value is of the format "SU-" appended with the
   relevant JWS alg value for the chosen public and ephemeral key-pair
   algorithm, for example "SU-ES256".

6.2.  Presentation Internal Representation

   Some algorithms (such as Single use and MAC) use a holder key to
   provide integrity over the presentation.  For these algorithms, an
   internal binary form of the presentation must be generated both for
   signing by the holder, and for verification by the verifier.  Other
   algorithms MAY use this same form for consistency.

   The instructions for creating this binary representation will also
   create well-formed CBOR, although this data is not meant to be shared
   outside the implementing algorithm.  Instead, it focuses on
   simplicity of generation by the holder and verifier implementations.
   Although CBOR has multiple representations of the same underlying
   information, this same octet string MUST be generated by an
   implementation.

   When a length or count is added by the steps below, it is added as
   its 8 byte, network-ordered representation.  For example, the length
   of a 1,234 byte payload would have a length representation of 0x00 00
   00 00 00 00 04 D2.

   The binary representation is created by appending data into a single
   octet string in the following order:

   1.   0x84 5B

   2.   The length and octets of the presentation protected header

   3.   0x5B

   4.   The length and octets of the issuer protected header

   5.   0x9B

   6.   The number of payload slots in the issued message

   7.   For each payload representation:

        *  If the payload is being omitted, the value 0xF6

        *  Otherwise:

           1.  0x5B
           2.  The length and octets of the payload

   8.   0x9B

   9.   The number of proof components as specified by the algorithm

   10.  For each proof component, append:

        1.  0x5B
        2.  The length and octets of the proof component

6.3.  BBS

   The BBS Signature Scheme [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] is under
   active development within the CRFG.

   This algorithm supports both selective disclosure and unlinkability,
   enabling the holder to generate multiple presentations from one
   issued JWP without a verifier being able to correlate those
   presentations together based on the proof.

6.3.1.  JPA Algorithms

   The BBS algorithm corresponds to a ciphersuite identifier of
   BBS_BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_.

6.3.2.  Key Format

   The key used for the BBS algorithm is an elliptic curve-based key
   pair, specifically against the G_2 subgroup of a pairing friendly
   curve.  Additional details on key generation can be found in
   Section 3.4.  The JWK and Cose Key Object representations of the key
   are detailed in [I-D.ietf-cose-bls-key-representations].

   There is no additional holder presentation key necessary for
   presentation proofs.

6.3.3.  Issuance

   Issuance is performed using the Sign operation from Section 3.5.1 of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].  This operation utilizes the issuer's
   BLS12-381 G2 key pair as SK and PK, along with desired protected
   header octets as header, and the array of payload octet string as
   messages.

   The octets resulting from this operation form a single octet string
   in the issuance proof array, to be used along with the protected
   header and payloads to serialize the JWP.

6.3.4.  Issuance Proof Verification

   Holder verification of the signature on issuance form is performed
   using the Verify operation from [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures,
   section 3.5.2].

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the proof as
   signature, the protected header octets as header and the array of
   payload octets as messages.

6.3.5.  Presentation

   Derivation of a presentation is done by the holder using the ProofGen
   operation from Section 3.5.3 of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the issuer
   protected header as header, the issuance proof as signature, the
   issuance payloads as messages, and the holder's presentation
   protected header as ph.

   The operation also takes a vector of indexes into messages,
   describing which payloads the holder wishes to disclose.  All
   payloads are required for proof generation, but only these indicated
   payloads will be required to be disclosed for later proof
   verification.

   The output of this operation is the presentation proof, as a single
   octet string.

   Presentation serialization leverages the two protected headers and
   presentation proof, along with the disclosed payloads.  Non-disclosed
   payloads are represented with the absent value of null in CBOR
   serialization and a zero-length string in compact serialization.

6.3.6.  Presentation Verification

   Verification of a presentation is done by the verifier using the
   ProofVerify operation from [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures,
   Section 3.5.4].

   This operation utilizes the issuer's public key as PK, the issuer
   protected header as header, the issuance proof as signature, the
   holder's presentation protected header as ph, and the payloads as
   disclosed_messages.

   In addition, the disclosed_indexes scalar array is calculated from
   the payloads provided.  Values disclosed in the presented payloads
   have a zero-based index in this array, while the indices of absent
   payloads are omitted.

6.4.  Message Authentication Code

   The Message Authentication Code (MAC) JPA uses a MAC to both generate
   ephemeral secrets and to authenticate payloads, along with an
   asymmetric signature to provide integrity to the issued JWP.

   The holder can manipulate which payloads are disclosed from the
   issued JWP, and uses the Holder Presentation Key to create a
   presentation.  The signature created from the Holder Presentation Key
   MAY use a different algorithm than the Issuer used to sign the issued
   form.

   Like the Single Use algorithm family, it also does not support
   unlinkability if the same JWP is presented multiple times and
   requires an individually issued JWP for each presentation in order to
   fully protect privacy.  When compared to the JWS approach, using a
   MAC requires less computation but can result in potentially larger
   presentation proof values.

   The design is intentionally minimal and only involves using a single
   standardized MAC method instead of a mix of MAC/hash methods or a
   custom hash-based construct.  It is able to use any published
   cryptographic MAC method such as HMAC [RFC2104] or KMAC
   (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/
   NIST.SP.800-185.pdf).  It uses traditional public key-based
   signatures to verify the authenticity of the issuer and holder.

6.4.1.  Holder Setup

   In order to support the protection of a presentation by a holder to a
   verifier, the holder MUST use a Holder Presentation Key during the
   issuance and the presentation of every MAC JWP.  This Holder
   Presentation Key MUST be generated and used for only one JWP if
   unlinkability is desired.

   The issuer MUST verify that the holder has possession of this key.
   The holder-issuer communication to exchange this information is out
   of scope of this specification, but can be accomplished by the holder
   using this key to generate a JWS that signs a value the issuer can
   verify as unique.

   The holder's presentation key MUST be included in the issuer's
   protected header using the Holder Presentation Key header parameter.

   The issuer MUST determine an appropriate holder presentation
   algorithm corresponding to the holder presentation key.  If the
   holder and verifier cannot be assumed to know this algorithm is the
   appropriate choice for a given holder presentation key, this value
   MUST be conveyed in the Holder Protected Algorithm header parameter.

6.4.2.  Issuer Setup

   To use the MAC algorithm, the issuer must have a stable public key
   pair to perform signing.  To start the issuance process, a single
   32-byte random Shared Secret must first be generated.  This value
   will be shared privately with the holder as part of the issuer's JWP
   proof value.

   The Shared Secret is used by both the issuer and holder as the MAC
   method's key to generate a new set of unique ephemeral keys.  These
   keys are then used as the input to generate a MAC that protects each
   payload.

6.4.3.  Combined MAC Representation

   The combined MAC representation is a single octet string representing
   the MAC values of the issuer protected header, along with each
   payload provided by the issuer.  This representation is signed by the
   issuer, but not shared - parties will recreate this octet string and
   verify the signature to verify the integrity of supplied issuer
   protected header and the integrity of any disclosed payloads.

   The steps below describe a sequential concatenation of binary values
   to generate the Combined MAC Representation.  The instructions for
   generating this octet string will also generate well-formed CBOR,
   although this data is not meant to be shared outside the implementing
   algorithm.  Instead, it focuses on simplicity of generation by the
   issuer, holder, and verifier implementations.  Although CBOR has
   multiple representations of the same underlying information, this
   same octet string MUST be generated by an implementation.

   When a length or count is added by steps in this section, it is added
   as its 8-byte, network-ordered representation.  For example, the
   length of a 1,234-byte payload would have a length representation of
   0x00 00 00 00 00 00 04 D2.

   The holder will a unique key per payload value using a MAC, with the
   Shared Secret as the key and a generated binary value.  This binary
   value is constructed by appending data into a single octet string:

   1.  0x82 67 70 61 79 6C 6F 61 64 1B
   2.  The zero indexed count of the payload slot

   The holder will also compute a corresponding MAC of each payload.
   This MAC uses the unique key above and the payload octet string as
   the value.

   When verifying a presentation, the shared secret will be unavailable
   so the unique key cannot be calculated.  The payload octet string may
   also be omitted in the presentation.  The following instructions
   describe how to get the corresponding MAC of each payload:

   *  If the payload is disclosed, the corresponding proof component (as
      described in MAC Presentation Proof (#mac-presentation-proof))
      will contain the generated unique key.  The payload MAC will be
      calculated using this key and the payload octets as the value.
   *  If the payload is not disclosed, the corresponding proof component
      will be the payload MAC.

   The binary representation is created by appending data into a single
   octet string in the following order:

   1.  0x82 5B
   2.  The length and octets of the issuer protected header
   3.  0x9B
   4.  The number of payload slots in the issued JWP
   5.  For each payload representation:
       1.  0x5B
       2.  The length and value of the per payload MAC

6.4.4.  Issuer Protected Header

   The Holder's Presentation Key MUST be included via the Holder
   Presentation Key header parameter.

   The Holder's Presentation Algorithm MUST be included via the Holder
   Presentation Algorithm header parameter unless there is another way
   for the holder and verifier to unambiguously determine the
   appropriate algorithm to use.

6.4.5.  Issuer Proof

   The issuer proof consists of two octet strings.

   The first octet string is the issuer signature over the combined MAC
   representation.  The issuer signs the combined MAC representation
   using its stable public key, and the internal signing algorithm for
   the given fully-specified MAC algorithm variant.

   The second octet string is the Shared Secret used to generate the
   per-payload keys for the combined representation.

6.4.6.  Presentation Protected Header

   See the Presentation Protected Header (#presentation-protected-
   header) section given for Single Use algorithms.

6.4.7.  Presentation Proof

   The presentation proof is made of multiple components.

   The first proof component is the issuer signature over the Combined
   MAC Representation, which is provided as the first proof component
   from the issued form.

   There will now be one proof component per payload slot in the issued
   JWP.  These are used by the verifier to reconstruct the combined MAC
   representation without access to the Shared Secret.  The proof
   components are calculated per the instructions used to generate the
   Combined MAC Representation (#combined-mac-representation)

   If a payload is disclosed, the corresponding proof component will be
   the unique key.

   If a payload is not disclosed, the corresponding proof component will
   be the payload's MAC (using the unique key.)

   The holder protected header, issuer protected header, payload slots
   (distinguishing which are being disclosed) and above proof components
   are inputs to determine the presentation internal representation
   (#presentation-internal-representation).

   The holder's signature over the presentation internal representation
   (using the holder's private key and the holder presentation
   algorithm) is then included as one additional proof component in the
   final presentation.

   The presented form should have two more proof components than payload
   slots in the issued JWP.

   Note that the second component of the issued JWP is a shared secret
   for use by the holder to generate the unique keys used in the
   Combined MAC Representation.  This MUST NOT be included in the
   presentation.

6.4.8.  Verification of the Presentation Proof

   Verification is performed using the following steps.

   1.  Check the number of proof components is appropriate for the
       number of disclosed payloads.  There MUST be two more proof
       components than disclosed payloads.
   2.  Using the fully-specified MAC algorithm in use, use the issuer
       protected header, disclosed payloads, and the proof components
       corresponding to the payloads to regenerate the Combined MAC
       Representation.
   3.  Verify the first proof component is a valid signature over the
       issuer protected header octets, using the issuer's stable key.
   4.  Extract the holder presentation key and holder presentation
       algorithm (if present) from the issuer protected header.
   5.  Omitting the final payload component, calculate the presentation
       internal representation (#presentation-internal-representation).
   6.  Verify the final proof component is a valid signature over the
       presentation internal binary form, using the holder's
       presentation key and the extracted (or otherwise determined)
       holder presentation algorithm.

6.4.9.  JPA Registration

   Proposed JWP alg value is of the format "MAC-" appended with a unique
   identifier for the set of MAC and signing algorithms used.  Below are
   the initial registrations:

   *  MAC-H256 uses HMAC SHA-256 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-256 and
      SHA-256 for the signatures
   *  MAC-H384 uses HMAC SHA-384 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-384 and
      SHA-384 for the signatures
   *  MAC-H512 uses HMAC SHA-512 as the MAC and ECDSA using P-521 and
      SHA-512 for the signatures
   *  MAC-K25519 uses KMAC SHAKE128 as the MAC and EdDSA using
      Curve25519 for the signatures
   *  MAC-K448 uses KMAC SHAKE256 as the MAC and EdDSA using Curve448
      for the signatures
   *  MAC-H256K uses HMAC SHA-256 as the MAC and ECDSA using secp256k1
      and SHA-256 for the signatures

7.  Security Considerations

   |  Editor's Note: This will follow once the algorithms defined here
   |  have become more stable.

   *  Data minimization of the proof value
   *  Unlinkability of the protected header contents

8.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the jose-reg-review@ietf.org
   (mailto:jose-reg-review@ietf.org) mailing list, on the advice of one
   or more Designated Experts.  However, to allow for the allocation of
   values prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve
   registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will
   be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register JWP algorithm:
   example").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org (mailto:iesg@ietf.org) mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
   description is clear.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

8.1.  JSON Web Proof Algorithms Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "JSON Web Proof Algorithms"
   registry for values of the JWP alg (algorithm) parameter in JWP
   Header Parameters.  The registry records the algorithm name, the
   algorithm description, the algorithm usage locations, the
   implementation requirements, the change controller, and a reference
   to the specification that defines it.  The same algorithm name can be
   registered multiple times, provided that the sets of usage locations
   are disjoint.

   It is suggested that the length of the key be included in the
   algorithm name when multiple variations of algorithms are being
   registered that use keys of different lengths and the key lengths for
   each need to be fixed (for instance, because they will be created by
   key derivation functions).  This allows readers of the JSON text to
   more easily make security decisions.

   The Designated Experts should perform reasonable due diligence that
   algorithms being registered either are currently considered
   cryptographically credible or are being registered as Deprecated or
   Prohibited.

   The implementation requirements of an algorithm may be changed over
   time as the cryptographic landscape evolves, for instance, to change
   the status of an algorithm to Deprecated or to change the status of
   an algorithm from Optional to Recommended+ or Required.  Changes of
   implementation requirements are only permitted on a Specification
   Required basis after review by the Designated Experts, with the new
   specification defining the revised implementation requirements level.

8.1.1.  Registration Template

   Algorithm Name:  Brief descriptive name of the algorithm (e.g.,
      Single-Use JWP using ES256.)  Descriptive names may not match
      other registered names unless the Designated Experts state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.
   Algorithm JSON Label:  The string label requested (e.g., SU-ES256).
      This label is a case-sensitive ASCII string.  JSON Labels may not
      match other registered labels in a case-insensitive manner unless
      the Designated Experts state that there is a compelling reason to
      allow an exception.
   Algorithm CBOR Label:  The integer label requested (e.g., 1).  CBOR
      Labels may not match other registered labels unless the Designated
      Experts state that there is a compelling reason to allow an
      exception.
   Algorithm Description:  Optional additional information clarifying
      the algorithm.  This may be used for example to document
      additional chosen parameters.
   Algorithm Usage Location(s):  The algorithm usage locations, which
      should be one or more of the values Issued or Presented.  Other
      values may be used with the approval of a Designated Expert.
   JWP Implementation Requirements:  The algorithm implementation
      requirements for JWP, which must be one the words Required,
      Recommended, Optional, Deprecated, or Prohibited.  Optionally, the
      word can be followed by a + or -. The use of + indicates that the
      requirement strength is likely to be increased in a future version
      of the specification.  The use of - indicates that the requirement
      strength is likely to be decreased in a future version of the
      specification.  Any identifiers registered for algorithms that are
      otherwise unsuitable for direct use as JWP algorithms must be
      registered as Prohibited.
   Change Controller:  For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, email address, home page URI) may also be
      included.
   Specification Document(s):  Reference to the document or documents
      that specify the parameter, preferably including URIs that can be
      used to retrieve copies of the documents.  An indication of the
      relevant sections may also be included but is not required.
   Algorithm Analysis Documents(s):  References to a publication or
      publications in well-known cryptographic conferences, by national
      standards bodies, or by other authoritative sources analyzing the
      cryptographic soundness of the algorithm to be registered.  The
      Designated Experts may require convincing evidence of the
      cryptographic soundness of a new algorithm to be provided with the
      registration request unless the algorithm is being registered as
      Deprecated or Prohibited.  Having gone through working group and
      IETF review, the initial registrations made by this document are
      exempt from the need to provide this information.

Appendix A.  Example JWPs

   The following examples use algorithms defined in JSON Proof
   Algorithms and also contain the keys used, so that implementations
   can validate these samples.

A.1.  Example JSON-Serialized Single-Use JWP

   This example uses the Single-Use Algorithm as defined in JSON Proof
   Algorithms to create a JSON Proof Token.  It demonstrates how to
   apply selective disclosure using an array of traditional JWS-based
   signatures.  Unlinkability is only achieved by using each JWP one
   time, as multiple uses are inherently linkable via the traditional
   ECDSA signature embedded in the proof.

   To begin, we need two asymmetric keys for Single Use: one that
   represents the JPT Issuer's stable key and the other is an ephemeral
   key generated by the Issuer just for this JWP.

   This is the Issuer's stable private key used in this example in the
   JWK format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "i_Z_bPAFjYkauFJGwP0Bb9M_US7C5CAKlCy88he-xSI",
     "y": "RcFnvnmnLK2sfo280NOaEtevRgYUquBOAAEp7s98Z0E",
     "d": "cdSyxqimC7atqvhLnQ6x1079YGsZAECaDGpEtboyzyI"
   }

                Figure 1: Issuer Private Key (ES256 in JWK)

   This is the ephemeral private key used in this example in the JWK
   format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",
     "x": "CKivX6GiDIO_0-HjzkYzWWFo1Sx_5arYEQ-u_cM876M",
     "y": "C69M7i1nZMlvz79_8TYd135gJZqzzj4bEakQ8ucIvJ8",
     "d": "X2KGIA4by9ygXFY2fZVsPh9kxSKqXtRgxW0wAoqoSxc"
   }

           Figure 2: Issuer Ephemeral Private Key (ES256 in JWK)

   This is the Holder's presentation private key used in this example in
   the JWK format:

   {
     "kty": "EC",
     "crv": "P-256",

   The JWP Protected Header declares that the data structure is a JPT
   and the JWP Proof Input is secured using the Single-Use ECDSA
   algorithm with the P-256 curve and SHA-256 digest.  It also includes
   the ephemeral public key, the Holder's presentation public key and
   list of claims used for this JPT.

    Figure 5: Encoded Issuer Protected Header (SU-ES256, JSON, encoded)

   The Single Use algorithm utilizes multiple individual JWS Signatures.
   Each signature value is generated by creating a JWS with a single
   Protected Header with the associated alg value.  In this example, the
   fixed header used for each JWS is the serialized JSON Object
   {"alg":"ES256"}.  This protected header will be used to generate a
   signature over each corresponding payload in the JWP.  The
   corresponding octet value in the proof is the octet string
   (base64url-decoded) value of the signature.

   The final proof value from the Issuer is an array with the octets of
   the header signature, followed by entries for each payload signature.

   To present this JPT, we first use the following presentation header
   with a nonce (provided by the Verifier):

   {
     "alg": "SU-ES256",
     "aud": "https://recipient.example.com",

   We apply selective disclosure of only the given name and age claims
   (family name and email hidden), and remove the proof components
   corresponding to these entries.

   Using the selectively disclosed information, we generate the
   presentation internal representation.  Using that and the selectively

      Figure 19: Example issuer payloads (as members of a JSON array)

   The issuer generates an array of derived keys, one per payload slot.
   This is done using the shared secret as the key and a binary value
   based on the payload slot index (from zero) as input to the HMAC
   operation.

   This results in the following set of derived keys:

            Figure 20: Derived payload keys (Base64url-Encoded)

   A MAC is generated for each payload using the corresponding derived
   payload key.  This results in the following set of MAC values:

             Figure 21: Payload MAC values (Base64url-Encoded)

   The issuer protected header and payload MAC values are combined into
   a binary representation known as the Compact MAC Representation.
   This representation is signed with the issuer's private key.

   The proof consists of two octet string values: the signature over the
   combined MAC representation, and the shared secret.

   Next, we show the presentation of the JWP with selective disclosure.

   For presentation with the following presentation protected header:

   {
     "alg": "MAC-H256",
     "aud": "https://recipient.example.com",
     "nonce": "bVvMg_5vEl_GKU345obR3Wgfgg3j3_NNYJO9J5PxEGw"
   }

                  Figure 24: Presentation Protected Header

   The holder will take the issuer proof (including shared secret) and
   derive the same individual payload MAC values (above).

   In this case, the holder has decided not to disclose the last three
   claims provided by the issuer (corresponding to email, address, and
   age_over_21)

   For each payload slot, the holder will provide one of two values as
   part of the proof value.  For a disclosed payload, the holder will
   provide the corresponding derived key.  For a non-disclosed payload,
   the holder will provide the corresponding MAC value.

   The final presented proof value is an array of octet strings.  The
   contents are presentation header signature, followed by the issuer
   signature, then the value disclosed by the holder for each payload.
   This results in the following proof:

Appendix C.  Document History

   [[ To be removed from the final specification ]]

   -10

   *  Clarify MAC issuance and presentation using new "payload slot"
      nomenclature.
   *  Define a new binary "Presentation Internal Representation" so that
      the holder signature protects the entire presentation
   *  Leverage the new "Holder Presentation Algorithm" to allow the
      holder algorithm to be independent from the signature algorithm
      used by the issuer
   *  Redefine computation of the "Combined MAC Representation" to more
      closely match the new Presentation Internal Representation.
   *  Change the MAC algorithm to directly sign the binary Combined MAC
      Representation rather than convert it to a JWS.
   *  Do not unnecessarily hash the issuer protected header inside the
      Combined MAC Representation, so that it can provide some manner of
      domain separation.
   *  Clarify how verifiers are to generate the Combined MAC
      Representation from available information.
   *  Provider step-by-step instructions for verification of a
      presentation
   *  Change Proof Key to Issuer Ephemeral Key and Presentation Key to
      Holder Presentation Key

   *  Correct pjwk to presentation_jwk

   -05

   *  Update of appendix describing MAC-H256 to now also be generated by
      the build system from a common set of code and templates.
   *  Update single use algorithm to use an array of octet values rather
      than requiring splitting an octet buffer into parts during
      generation of a presentation and during verification.
   *  Update BBS algorithm description and examples to clarify the proof
      is an array with a single octet string.
   *  Update MAC algorithm to use an array of octet values for the
      proof, rather than requiring splitting an octet buffer into parts.
   *  Add new section on the Combined MAC Representation to clarify
      operations are serving to recreate this octet string value.
   *  Correct reference to the latest BBS draft.
   *  SU and MAC families now use raw JWA rather than JWS and
      synthesized headers
   *  Change algorithms to not use base64url-encoding internally.
      Algorithms are meant to operate on octets, while base64url-
      encoding is used to represent those octets in JSON and compact
      serializations.

   -04

   *  Refactoring figures and examples to be built from a common set
      across all three documents
   *  Move single-use example appendix from JWP to JPA
   *  Change algorithm from BBS-DRAFT-5 to BBS, and from BBS-PROOF-
      DRAFT-5 to BBS-PROOF
   *  Update BBS ciphersuite ID to BBS_BLS12381G1_XMD:SHA-256_SSWU_RO_
   *  Update to draft 5 BLS key representations

   -03

   *  Improvements resulting from a full proofreading.
   *  Populated IANA Considerations section.
   *  Updated to use BBS draft -05.
   *  Updated examples.

   -02

   *  Add new BBS-DRAFT-3 and BBS-PROOF-DRAFT-3 algorithms based on
      draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-03.
   *  Remove prior BBS-X algorithm based on a particular implementation
      of earlier drafts.

   -01

   *  Correct cross-references within group
   *  Describe issuer_header and presentation_header
   *  Update BBS references to CFRG drafts
   *  Rework reference to HMAC ( RFC2104 )
   *  Remove ZKSnark placeholder

   -00

   *  Created initial working group draft based on draft-jmiller-jose-
      json-proof-algorithms-01
