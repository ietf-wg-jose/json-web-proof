                             JSON Web Proof
                 draft-ietf-jose-json-web-proof-latest

Abstract

   The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats
   for Keys, Signatures, and Encryption.  They also established IANA
   registries to enable the algorithms and representations used for them
   to be extended.  Since those were created, newer cryptographic
   algorithms that support selective disclosure and unlinkability have
   matured and started seeing early market adoption.

   This document defines a new container format similar in purpose and
   design to JSON Web Signature (JWS) called a _JSON Web Proof (JWP)_.
   Unlike JWS, which integrity-protects only a single payload, JWP can
   integrity-protect multiple payloads in one message.  It also
   specifies a new presentation form that supports selective disclosure
   of individual payloads, enables additional proof computation, and
   adds a protected header to prevent replay.

1.  Introduction

   The JOSE specifications are very widely deployed and well supported,
   enabling use of cryptographic primitives with a JSON representation.
   JWTs [RFC7519] are one of the most common representations for
   identity and access claims.  For instance, they are used by the
   OpenID Connect and Secure Telephony Identity Revisited (STIR)
   standards.  Also, JWTs are used by W3C's Verifiable Credentials and
   are used in many decentralized identity systems.

   With these new use cases, there is an increased focus on adopting
   privacy-protecting cryptographic primitives.  While such primitives
   are still an active area of academic and applied research, the
   leading candidates introduce new patterns that are not currently
   supported by JOSE.  These new patterns are largely focused on two
   areas: supporting selective disclosure when presenting information
   and minimizing correlation through the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs
   (ZKPs) in addition to traditional signatures.

   There are a growing number of these cryptographic primitives that
   support selective disclosure while protecting privacy across multiple
   presentations.  Examples used in the context of Verifiable
   Credentials are:

   *  CL Signatures (https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/562.pdf)
   *  IDEMIX (http://www.zurich.ibm.com/idemix)
   *  BBS signatures, described in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]
   *  MerkleDisclosureProof2021 (https://github.com/transmute-
      industries/merkle-disclosure-proof-2021)
   *  Mercurial Signatures (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/979)
   *  PS Signatures (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/525.pdf)
   *  U-Prove (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/
      u-prove/)
   *  Spartan (https://github.com/microsoft/Spartan)

   All of these follow the same pattern of taking multiple claims
   (a.k.a., "attributes" or "messages" in the literature) and binding
   them together into a single issued token.  These are then later
   securely one-way transformed into a presentation that reveals
   potentially only a subset of the original claims, predicate proofs
   about the claim values, or proofs of knowledge of the claims.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The roles of "issuer", "holder", and "verifier" are used as defined
   by the VC Data Model [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0].  The term "presentation" is
   also used as defined by this source, but the term "credential" is
   avoided in this specification to minimize confusion with other
   definitions.

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this series of documents:

   binding: A mechanism, indicated in an issued JWP, for how to verify a
   presentation was created by the intended holder.

   linkability: The property where multiple presentations may be
   correlated to a single issued JWP, either through consistency in the
   cryptographic integrity or due to particulars of JWP usage by an
   application.  Such issued JWPs may be referred to as single-use, as
   multiple uses may leak unintended knowledge.

   unlinkability: The property of issuance and presentation algorithms
   and of application usage, where one presentation can only be
   correlated with other presentations based on holder-disclosed
   information.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   *  ZKP: Zero-Knowledge Proof
   *  JWP: JSON Web Proof (this specification)
   *  JPA: JSON Proof Algorithms [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms]
   *  JPT: JSON Proof Token [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-token]

3.  Background

   A _JSON Web Proof (JWP)_ is very similar to a JWS [RFC7515], with the
   addition that it can contain multiple individual secured payloads
   instead of a single one.  JWP-supporting algorithms are then able to
   separate and act on the individual payloads contained within.

   The intent of JSON Web Proof is to establish a common container
   format for multiple payloads that can be integrity-verified against a
   cryptographic proof value also in the container.  It does not create
   or specify any cryptographic protocols, multi-party protocols, or
   detail any algorithm-specific capabilities.

   To fully support the newer privacy primitives, JWP utilizes the three
   roles of issuer, holder, and verifier, as defined by the VC Data
   Model [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0].  There are also two forms of a JWP: the
   issued form created by an issuer for a holder, and the presented form
   created by a holder for a verifier.

   The four principal interactions used by JWP are issue, confirm,
   present, and verify.

   A JWP is initially created by the issuer using the issue interaction.
   A successful result is an issued JWP that has a single issuer-
   protected header, one or more payloads, and an initial proof value
   that contains the issuing algorithm output.  The holder, upon
   receiving an issued JWP, then uses the confirm interaction to check
   the integrity protection of the header and all payloads using the
   proof value.

   After validation, the holder uses the present interaction to apply
   any selective disclosure choices, perform privacy-preserving
   transformations for unlinkability, and add a presentation-protected
   header that ensures the resulting presented JWP cannot be replayed.
   The verifier then uses the verify interaction to ensure the integrity
   protection of the protected headers and any disclosed payloads, along
   with verifying any additional ZKPs covering non-disclosed payloads.

   While issue and confirm only occur when a JWP is initially created by
   the issuer, the present and verify steps may be safely repeated by a
   holder on an issued JWP.  He resulting presented JWP is only
   unlinkable when supported by the underlying algorithm.

   Algorithm definitions that support JWPs are in separate companion
   specifications - just as the JSON Web Algorithms [RFC7518]
   specification does for JWS and JWE [RFC7516].  The JSON Proof
   Algorithms (JPA) [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms] specification
   defines how an initial set of algorithms are used with JWP.

4.  JWP Header

   The members of the JSON object(s) representing the JWP Header
   describe the proof applied to the Protected Header and the Payload
   and optionally, additional properties of the JWP.  The Header
   Parameter names within the JWP Header MUST be unique; JWP parsers
   MUST either reject JWPs with duplicate Header Parameter names or use
   a JSON parser that returns only the lexically last duplicate member
   name, as specified in Section 15.12 ("The JSON Object") of ECMAScript
   5.1 [ECMAScript].

   Implementations are required to understand the specific Header
   Parameters defined by this specification that are designated as "MUST
   be understood" and process them in the manner defined in this
   specification.  All other Header Parameters defined by this
   specification that are not so designated MUST be ignored when not
   understood.  Unless listed as a critical Header Parameter, per
   Section 4.1.4, all Header Parameters not defined by this
   specification MUST be ignored when not understood.

   There are three classes of Header Parameter names: Registered Header
   Parameter names, Public Header Parameter names, and Private Header
   Parameter names.

   These requirements are intentionally parallel to those in Section 4
   of [RFC7515].

4.1.  Registered Header Parameter Names

   The following Header Parameter names for use in JWPs are registered
   in the IANA "JSON Web Proof Header Parameters" registry established
   by Section 10.1, with meanings as defined in the subsections below.

   As indicated by the common registry, Header Parameters used in the
   Issued Form (see Section 5.1) and the Presented Form Section 5.2
   share a common Header Parameter space; when a parameter is used by
   both forms, its usage must be compatible between them.

   These Header Parameters are intentionally parallel to those in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC7515].

4.1.1.  "alg" (Algorithm) Header Parameter

   The alg (algorithm) Header Parameter identifies the cryptographic
   algorithm used to secure the JWP.  The JWP Proof value is not valid
   if the alg value does not represent a supported algorithm or if there
   is not a key for use with that algorithm associated with the party
   that secured the content. alg values should either be registered in
   the IANA "JSON Web Proof Algorithms" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms] or be a value that contains a
   Collision-Resistant Name.  The alg value is a case-sensitive ASCII
   string containing a StringOrURI value.  This Header Parameter MUST be
   present and MUST be understood and processed by implementations.

   A list of defined alg values for this use can be found in the IANA
   "JSON Web Proof Algorithms" registry established by
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms]; the initial contents of this
   registry are registered by [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms].

4.1.2.  "kid" (Key ID) Header Parameter

   The kid (key ID) Header Parameter is a hint indicating which key was
   used to secure the JWP.  This parameter allows originators to
   explicitly signal a change of key to recipients.  The structure of
   the kid value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be a case-sensitive
   string.  Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

   When used with a JWK, the kid value is used to match a JWK kid
   parameter value.

4.1.3.  "typ" (Type) Header Parameter

   The typ (type) Header Parameter is used by JWP applications to
   declare the media type (#IANA.MediaTypes) of this complete JWP.  This
   is intended for use by the application when more than one kind of
   object could be present in an application data structure that can
   contain a JWP; the application can use this value to disambiguate
   among the different kinds of objects that might be present.  It will
   typically not be used by applications when the kind of object is
   already known.  This parameter is ignored by JWP implementations; any
   processing of this parameter is performed by the JWP application.
   Use of this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

   Per [RFC2045], all media type values, subtype values, and parameter
   names are case insensitive.  However, parameter values are case
   sensitive unless otherwise specified for the specific parameter.

   To keep messages compact in common situations, it is RECOMMENDED that
   producers omit an "application/" prefix of a media type value in a
   typ Header Parameter when no other '/' appears in the media type
   value.  A recipient using the media type value MUST treat it as if
   "application/" were prepended to any typ value not containing a '/'.
   For instance, a typ value of example SHOULD be used to represent the
   application/example media type, whereas the media type application/
   example;part="1/2" cannot be shortened to example;part="1/2".

   The typ value jwp can be used by applications to indicate that this
   object is a JWP using the JWP Compact Serialization.  The typ value
   jwp+json can be used by applications to indicate that this object is
   a JWP using the JWP JSON Serialization.  Other type values can also
   be used by applications.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the typ Header Parameter be used for explicit
   typing, in parallel to the recommendations in Section 3.11 of
   [RFC8725].

4.1.4.  "crit" (Critical) Header Parameter

   The crit (critical) Header Parameter indicates that extensions to
   this specification and/or [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms] are
   being used that MUST be understood and processed.  Its value is an
   array listing the Header Parameter names present in the JWP Header
   that use those extensions.  If any of the listed extension Header
   Parameters are not understood and supported by the recipient, then
   the JWP is invalid.  Producers MUST NOT include Header Parameter
   names defined by this specification or
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms] for use with JWP, duplicate
   names, or names that do not occur as Header Parameter names within
   the JWP Header in the crit list.  Producers MUST NOT use the empty
   list [] as the crit value.  Recipients MAY consider the JWP to be
   invalid if the critical list contains any Header Parameter names
   defined by this specification or
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-proof-algorithms] for use with JWP or if any
   other constraints on its use are violated.  When used, this Header
   Parameter MUST be integrity protected; therefore, it MUST occur only
   within the JWP Protected Header.  Use of this Header Parameter is
   OPTIONAL.  This Header Parameter MUST be understood and processed by
   implementations.

4.1.5.  "proof_jwk" (Proof JWK) Header Parameter

   The proof_jwk (Proof JWK) represents the public key used by the
   issuer for proof of possession.  This key is represented as a JSON
   Web Key public key value.  It MUST contain only public key parameters
   and SHOULD contain only the minimum JWK parameters necessary to
   represent the key; other JWK parameters included can be checked for
   consistency and honored, or they can be ignored.  This Header
   Parameter MUST be present in the JWP issuer header parameters and
   MUST be understood and processed by implementations.

4.1.6.  "presentation_jwk" (Presentation JWK) Header Parameter

   The presentation_jwk (Presentation JWK) represents the public key
   used by the holder for proof of possession.  This key is represented
   as a JSON Web Key public key value.  It MUST contain only public key
   parameters and SHOULD contain only the minimum JWK parameters
   necessary to represent the key; other JWK parameters included can be
   checked for consistency and honored, or they can be ignored.  This
   Header Parameter MUST be present in the JWP issuer header parameters
   and MUST be understood and processed by implementations.

4.1.7.  "iss" (Issuer) Header Parameter

   The iss (issuer) Header Parameter identifies the principal that
   issued the JWP.  The processing of this claim is generally
   application specific.  The iss value is a case-sensitive string
   containing a StringOrURI value.  Its definition is intentionally
   parallel to the iss claim defined in [RFC7519].  Use of this Header
   Parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.8.  "aud" (Audience) Header Parameter

   The aud (audience) Header Parameter identifies the recipients that
   the JWP is intended for.  Each principal intended to process the JWP
   MUST identify itself with a value in the audience Header Parameter.
   If the principal processing the Header Parameter does not identify
   itself with a value in the aud Header Parameter when this Header
   Parameter is present, then the JWP MUST be rejected.  In the general
   case, the aud value is an array of case-sensitive strings, each
   containing a StringOrURI value.  In the special case when the JWP has
   one audience, the aud value MAY be a single case-sensitive string
   containing a StringOrURI value.  The interpretation of audience
   values is generally application specific.  Its definition is
   intentionally parallel to the aud claim defined in [RFC7519].  Use of
   this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.1.9.  "nonce" (Nonce) Header Parameter

   The nonce (nonce) Header Parameter is a case-sensitive string value
   used to associate protocol state with a JWP.  This can be used, for
   instance, to mitigate replay attacks.  The use of nonce values is
   generally protocol specific.  Its definition is intentionally
   parallel to the nonce claim registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token
   Claims" registry (#IANA.JWT.Claims).  Use of this Header Parameter is
   OPTIONAL.

4.1.10.  "claims" (Claims) Header Parameter

   The claims Header Parameter is an array listing the Claim Names
   corresponding to the JWP payloads, in the same order as the payloads.
   Each array value is a Claim Name, as defined in [RFC7519].  Use of
   this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

4.2.  Public Header Parameter Names

   Additional Header Parameter names can be defined by those using JWPs.
   However, in order to prevent collisions, any new Header Parameter
   name should either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Proof Header
   Parameters" registry established by Section 10.1 or be a Public Name
   (a value that contains a Collision-Resistant Name).  In each case,
   the definer of the name or value needs to take reasonable precautions
   to make sure they are in control of the part of the namespace they
   use to define the Header Parameter name.

   New Header Parameters should be introduced sparingly, as they can
   result in non-interoperable JWPs.

4.3.  Private Header Parameter Names

   A producer and consumer of a JWP may agree to use Header Parameter
   names that are Private Names (names that are not Registered Header
   Parameter names Section 4.1 or Public Header Parameter names
   Section 4.2.)  Unlike Public Header Parameter names, Private Header
   Parameter names are subject to collision and should be used with
   caution.

5.  JWP Forms

   A JWP is always in one of two forms: the issued form or the presented
   form.  A structural difference between the two forms is the number of
   protected headers.  An issued JWP has only one issuer protected
   header, while a presented JWP will have both the issuer protected
   header and an additional presentation protected header.  Each
   protected header is a JSON object that is serialized as a UTF-8
   encoded octet string.

   All JWP forms have one or more payloads; each payload is an octet
   string.  The payloads are arranged in an array for which the ordering
   is preserved in all serializations.

   The JWP proof value is one or more octet strings that are only meant
   to be generated from and processed by the underlying JPA.
   Internally, the proof value may contain one or more cryptographic
   statements that are used to check the integrity protection of the
   header(s) and all payloads.  Each of these statements may be a ZKP or
   a traditional cryptographic signature.  The algorithm is responsible
   for how these statements are serialized into a single proof value.

5.1.  Issued Form

   When a JWP is first created, it is always in the issued form.  It
   will contain the issuer protected header along with all of the
   payloads.

   The issued form can only be confirmed by a holder as being correctly
   formed and protected.  It is NOT to be verified directly or presented
   as-is to a verifier.  The holder SHOULD treat an issued JWP as
   private and use appropriately protected storage.

5.1.1.  Issuer Protected Header

   The issuer protected header applies to all of the payloads equally.
   It is recommended that any payload-specific information not be
   included in this header and instead be handled outside of the
   cryptographic envelope.  This is to minimize any correlatable signals
   in the metadata, to reduce a verifier's ability to group different
   presentations based on small header variations from the same issuer.
   The protected header is always disclosed, whereas payloads can be
   selectively disclosed.

   Every issuer protected header MUST have an alg value that identifies
   a valid JSON Proof Algorithm (JPA).

   For example:

   {
     "alg": "BBS"
   }

5.1.2.  Issuer Payloads

   Payloads are represented and processed as individual octet strings
   and arranged in an ordered array when there are multiple payloads.
   All application context of the placement and encoding of each payload
   value is out of scope of this specification and SHOULD be well
   defined and documented by the application or other specifications.

   JPAs MAY provide software interfaces that perform the encoding of
   individual payloads which accept native inputs such as numbers, sets,
   or elliptic curve points.  This enables the algorithm to support
   advanced features such as blinded values and predicate proofs.  These
   interfaces would generate the octet string encoded payload value as
   well as include protection of that payload in the combined proof
   value.

5.1.3.  Issuer Proof

   The issuer proof is one or more binary octet strings that are opaque
   to applications.  Individual proof-supporting algorithms are
   responsible for the contents and security of the proof value, along
   with any required internal structures.

   The issuer proof is used by the holder to perform validation,
   checking that the issuer header and all payloads are properly encoded
   and protected by the given proof.

5.2.  Presented Form

   When an issued JWP is presented, it undergoes a transformation that
   adds a presentation protected header.  It may also have one or more
   payloads hidden, disclosing only a subset of the original issued
   payloads.  The proof value will always be updated to add integrity
   protection of the presentation header along with the necessary
   cryptographic statements to verify the presented JWP.

   When supported by the underling JPA, a single issued JWP can be used
   to safely generate multiple presented JWPs without becoming
   correlatable.

   A JWP may also be single use, where an issued JWP can only be used
   once to generate a presented form.  In this case, any additional
   presentations would be inherently correlatable.  These are still
   useful for applications needing only selective disclosure or where
   new unique issued JWPs can be retrieved easily.

5.2.1.  Presentation Protected Header

   The presented form of a JWP MUST contain a presentation protected
   header.  It is added by the holder and MUST be integrity protected by
   the underling JPA.

   This header is used to ensure that a presented JWP cannot be replayed
   and is cryptographically bound to the verifier it was presented to.

   While there are not any required values in the presentation header,
   it MUST contain one or more header values that uniquely identify the
   presented JWP to both the holder and verifier.  For example, header
   values that would satisfy this requirement include nonce and aud.

5.2.2.  Presentation Payloads

   Any one or more payloads may be non-disclosed in a presented JWP.
   When a payload is not disclosed, the position of other payloads does
   not change; the resulting array will simply be sparse and only
   contain the disclosed payloads.

   The disclosed payloads will always be in the same array positions to
   preserve any index-based references by the application between the
   issued and presented forms of the JWP.  How the sparse array is
   represented is specific to the serialization used.

   Algorithms MAY support including a proof about a payload in the
   presentation.  Applications then treat that proven payload the same
   as any other non-disclosed payload and do not include it in the
   presented array of payloads.  Rather, proofs about payloads, such as
   "age >= 21", are included in the presentation proof.

5.2.3.  Presentation Proof

   The presentation proof is one or more binary octet strings that are
   opaque to applications.  Individual proof-supporting algorithms are
   responsible for the contents and security of the proof value, along
   with any required internal structures.

   The proof of a presented JWP will always be different than the issued
   proof.  At a minimum, it MUST be updated to include protection of the
   added presentation header.

   Algorithms SHOULD generate an un-correlatable presentation proof in
   order to support multiple presentations from a single issued JWP.

   The algorithm is responsible for representing selective disclosure of
   payloads in a presented proof.  If multiple octet strings are
   insufficient for representing a proof as defined by an algorithm, the
   algorithm is responsible for defining how such information is
   represented within one or more octet strings.

6.  Serializations

   Each disclosed payload MUST be base64url encoded when preparing it to
   be serialized.  The headers and proof are also individually base64url
   encoded.

   Like JWS, JWP supports both a Compact Serialization and a JSON
   Serialization.  These serializations both represent the same JSON-
   based header, payload and proof, and are thus interchangeable without
   breaking the proof value.

6.1.  Compact Serialization

   The compact serialiation provides a space-efficient encoding of a JWP
   in URL-safe characters.  In addition to the alphabet of unpadded
   BASE64 URL-safe encoding, it uses the "." and "~" characters as
   separators.

   All binary data is BASE64URL encoded, including the octets of the
   UTF-8 encoded headers and the individual payloads and proof values.

   Payloads and proofs are each concatenated into a single text form by
   concatenating the BASE64URL encoded values using the ~ character.

   Individual payloads are allowed to be omitted; if a payload is
   omitted, it is represented as a zero-length text value, potentially
   resulting in leading, trailing, or consecutive ~ characters in the
   concatenated form.

   If a payload or proof value was a zero-length octet string, it does
   not get output as its zero-length BASE64URL-encoded form but as a
   single _ character.  This character does not represent a valid
   BASE64URL-encoded octet string, allowing it to be distinguished from
   normally encoded data.

   The issued form is created by concatenating the base64url-encoded
   issuer protected header, concatenated payloads, and concatenated
   proof separated each by a . character.  The concatenated payloads MAY
   be omitted if the application is using detached payloads.

   The presented form is created by concatenating the base64url-encoded
   presenter protected header, base64url-encoded issuer protected
   header, concatenated payloads, and concatenated proof separated each
   by a . character.  The concatenated payloads MAY be omitted if the
   application is using detached payloads.

6.2.  JSON Serialization

   The JSON Serialization is in the form of a JSON object, with property
   names representing the various components.

   The issuer key has a string value holding the BASE64URL-encoded
   issuer protected header.  This key MUST be included.

   The presentation key has a string value holding the BASE64URL-encoded
   presentation protected header.  It MUST be included for presented
   form, and MUST be omitted for issued form.

   The payloads key has an array value, representing the ordered
   sequence of payloads.  If a payload has been omitted, it is
   represented by the JSON value null.  A payload is otherwise reprented
   by the BASE64URL-encoded form of the payload octets.  A zero-length
   payload does not have special encoding rules as needed by compact
   encoding, and is represented by the zero-length string output by
   BASE64URL.  This key MUST be included unless the application is using
   detached payloads.

   The proofs key has an array value, representing the array of octet
   strings produced by the chosen algorithm.  These octets are BASE64URL
   encoded into a JSON array.

   This example JSON serialization shows the presentation form with both
   the issuer and presentation headers, and with the first and third
   payloads hidden.

7.  Encrypted JSON Web Proofs

   Access to JWPs containing non-public material by parties without
   legitimate access to the non-public information MUST be prevented.
   This can be accomplished by encrypting the JWP when potentially
   observable by such parties to prevent the disclosure of private
   information.  The use of an Encrypted JWP, which is a JWE [RFC7516]
   with a JWP as its plaintext value, is recommended for this purpose.
   The processing of Encrypted JWPs is identical to the processing of
   other JWEs.

   The cty (content type) JWE Header Parameter is used to indicate that
   the content of the JWE is a JWP.  The cty value of the JWE SHOULD be
   the same as the typ (type) JWP Header Parameter value of the
   unencrypted JWP to be encrypted.  If the JWP has no typ value, then
   the following JWE Header Parameter cty (content type) values SHOULD
   be used:

   *  jwp is used to indicate that the content of the JWE is a JWP using
      the JWP Compact Serialization.
   *  jwp+json is used to indicate that the content of the JWE is the
      UTF-8 encoding of a JWP using the JWP JSON Serialization.

   The cty (content type) Header Parameter MUST be present unless the
   application knows that the encrypted content is a JWP by another
   means or convention, in which case the cty value MAY be omitted.

8.  Detached Payloads

   In some contexts, it is useful to make statements about payloads
   which are not themselves contained within the JWP, similar to
   "Detached Content" in JWS [RFC7515].

   For this purpose, the compact, JSON and CBOR serializations allow for
   all payloads to be omitted from a serialized form.  While this is a
   legal serialization, it is not on its own able to be verified.

   The recipient is expected to perform some sequence of steps defined
   by the application to recreate the array of payloads, including order
   and optionality.  This effectively recreates the fully specified
   serialization of the JWP.

9.  Security Considerations

   Notes to be expanded:

   *  Requirements for supporting algorithms, see JPA
   *  Application interface for verification
   *  Data minimization of the protected header
   *  To prevent accidentally introducing linkability, when an issuer
      uses the same key with the same grouping of payload types, they
      SHOULD also use the same issuer protected header.  Each of these
      headers SHOULD have the same base64url-serialized value to avoid
      any non-deterministic JSON serialization.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The following registration procedure is used for all the registries
   established by this specification.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the jose-reg-review@ietf.org
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register JWP header
   parameter: example").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   useful only for a single application, and whether the registration
   description is clear.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are
   able to represent the perspectives of different applications using
   this specification, in order to enable broadly informed review of
   registration decisions.  In cases where a registration decision could
   be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a particular
   Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other
   Experts.

10.1.  JSON Web Proof Header Parameters Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "JSON Web Proof Header
   Parameters" registry for Header Parameter names.  The registry
   records the Header Parameter name and a reference to the
   specification that defines it.  The same Header Parameter name can be
   registered multiple times, provided that the parameter usage is
   compatible between the specifications.  Different registrations of
   the same Header Parameter name will typically use different Header
   Parameter Usage Locations values.

10.1.1.  Registration Template

   *  Header Parameter Name: The name requested (e.g., "kid").  Because
      a core goal of this specification is for the resulting
      representations to be compact, it is RECOMMENDED that the name be
      short -- not to exceed 8 characters without a compelling reason to
      do so.  This name is case sensitive.  Names may not match other
      registered names in a case-insensitive manner unless the
      Designated Experts state that there is a compelling reason to
      allow an exception.
   *  Header Parameter Description: Brief description of the Header
      Parameter (e.g., "Key ID").
   *  Header Parameter Usage Location(s): The Header Parameter usage
      locations, which should be one or more of the values Issued or
      Presented.  Other values may be used with the approval of a
      Designated Expert.
   *  Change Controller: For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, email address, home page URI) may also be
      included.
   *  Specification Document(s): Reference to the document or documents
      that specify the parameter, preferably including URIs that can be
      used to retrieve copies of the documents.  An indication of the
      relevant sections may also be included but is not required.

10.3.  Structured Syntax Suffix Registration

10.3.1.  Registry Contents

   This section registers the +jwp structured syntax suffix [RFC6838] in
   the IANA "Structured Syntax Suffix" registry (#IANA.StructuredSuffix)
   in the manner described in [RFC6838], which can be used to indicate
   that the media type is encoded as a JWP using the JWP Compact
   Serialization.

   *  Name: JSON Web Proof (JWP)
   *  +suffix: +jwp
   *  References: Section 6.1 of this specification
   *  Encoding considerations: binary; JWP values are encoded as a
      series of base64url-encoded values (some of which may be the empty
      string) separated by period ('.') and tilde ('~') characters
   *  Interoperability considerations: n/a
   *  Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics of
      fragment identifiers specified for +jwp SHOULD be as specified for
      "application/jwp".  (At publication of this document, there is no
      fragment identification syntax defined for "application/jwp".)

   The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a specific
   "xxx/yyy+jwp" SHOULD be processed as follows:

   For cases defined in +jwp, where the fragment identifier resolves per
   the +jwp rules, then process as specified in +jwp.

   For cases defined in +jwp, where the fragment identifier does not
   resolve per the +jwp rules, then process as specified in "xxx/
   yyy+jwp".

   For cases not defined in +jwp, then process as specified in "xxx/
   yyy+jwp".
