                draft-ietf-jose-json-proof-token-latest

Abstract

   JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact, URL-safe, privacy-preserving
   representation of claims to be transferred between three parties.
   The claims in a JPT are encoded as base64url-encoded JSON objects
   that are used as the payloads of a JSON Web Proof (JWP) structure,
   enabling them to be digitally signed and selectively disclosed.  JPTs
   also support reusability and unlinkability when using Zero-Knowledge
   Proofs (ZKPs).

1.  Introduction

   JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact claims representation format
   intended to be used in the same ways as a JSON Web Token (JWT), but
   with additional support for selective disclosure and unlinkability.
   JPTs encode claim values to be transmitted as payloads of a JSON Web
   Proof (JWP) [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof].  JPTs are always
   represented using the JWP Compact Serialization.  The corresponding
   claim names are not transmitted in the payloads and are stored in a
   separate structure that can be externalized and shared across
   multiple JPTs.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background

   JWP defines a container binding together a protected header, one or
   more payloads, and a cryptographic proof.  It does not define how
   claims are organized into payloads and what formats they are in.
   JPTs are intended to be as close to a JWT as possible, while also
   supporting the selective disclosure and unlinkability of JWPs.

4.  Design Considerations

   The rationale behind the design for JSON Proof Tokens is important
   when considering how it is structured.  These sections detail the
   underlying reasoning informing the JPT design.

4.1.  Unlinkability

   Supporting unlinkability is perhaps the most challenging design
   constraint for JPTs.  Even the smallest oversight can introduce a
   subtle vector for relying parties to collude and correlate one or
   more subjects across their usage.

   The principal tools to prevent this are data minimization and
   uniformity.  The data included in a JPT SHOULD be minimized to remove
   potential correlation points.  The data SHOULD contain only values
   that are able to be selectively disclosed with consent or transformed
   by the proof algorithm when presented.

   Any other data that is repeated across multiple JPTs is externalized
   so that it is uniform across every issuance.  This includes
   preventing the usage of optional headers, dynamic mapping of claims
   to payloads, changes to how many payloads are included, and the
   ordering of the payloads.

4.2.  Selective Disclosure

   While JWPs provide the underling structure for easily supporting
   selective disclosure, JPTs must go a step further to ensure that
   holders can effectively provide choice and consent on exactly what is
   being disclosed.  Software using JWPs MUST know the mappings from
   payloads to claims.  All disclosed payloads MUST be mapped to claims
   and made accessible to the application.  Holders SHOULD understand
   the semantics of all potentially disclosed claims to the extent
   needed to decide whether to disclose them.  JPTs SHOULD NOT contain
   claims that are intended only for a specific verifier.

4.3.  Familiarity

   JPTs are intended to be as close to a JWT as possible in order to
   provide the simplest transition for any JWT-based system to add
   support for JPTs.

   Although there are some stark differences in the lifecycle of a JPT,
   from the application's perspective, the interface to a JPT can be
   made fairly similar: a JSON object containing a mix of required and
   optional claims with well-understood values.

   The most significant divergence required by JPTs is that of
   supporting values that may be disclosed or may instead only be a
   proof about the value.  Applications are required to interact with
   the JPT on a payload-by-payload basis instead of just verifying a JWT
   and then being able to interact with the JSON body directly.

4.4.  Proofs

   To generate a variety of efficient ZKPs of knowledge, range,
   membership, or other predicates, it is essential that each individual
   payload is only a single claim value.  This greatly simplifies the
   task of linking a derived proof of a given claim to the specific
   payload that was also signed by the issuer.  While JPTs support
   claims that have complex object or array compound values, they also
   allow for simple claim values such as JSON strings, numbers, and
   booleans that can be used directly in generating predicate proofs.

5.  Claim Names

   It is RECOMMENDED that the claim names used with JPTs come from those
   in the IANA JSON Web Token Claims Registry [IANA.JWT.Claims]
   established by [RFC7519], when those fit the application's needs.

6.  Claims Header Parameter

   A JSON Proof Token assigns each playload a claim name.  Payloads MUST
   each have a negotiated and understood claim name within the
   application context.  The simplest solution to establish payload
   claim names is as an ordered array that aligns with the included
   payloads.  This claims array can be conveniently included in the
   Claims header parameter.

   The claims Header Parameter is an array listing the Claim Names
   corresponding to the JWP payloads, in the same order as the payloads.
   Each array value is a Claim Name, as defined in [RFC7519].  Use of
   this Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

   All payloads are claim values and MUST be the base64url encoding of
   the UTF-8 representation of a JSON value.  That said, predicate
   proofs derived from payload values are not represented as claims;
   they are contained in the presentation proof using algorithm-specific
   representations.

   The following is an example JWP Issuer Protected Header that includes
   a claims property:

   {
     "kid": "HjfcpyjuZQ-O8Ye2hQnNbT9RbbnrobptdnExR0DUjU8",
     "alg": "BBS",
     "claims": [
       "iat",
       "exp",
       "family_name",
       "given_name",
       "email",
       "address",
       "age_over_21"
     ]
   }

   In this example, the "iat" and "exp" would be JSON-formatted numbers,
   "family_name", "given_name" and "email" would be JSON strings (in
   quotes), "address" would be a JSON object and "age_over_21" would be
   expected to be either true or false.

7.  Claims ID ("cid") JWP Header Parameter

   A Claims ID ("cid") value can be used as an identifier for a set of
   claim names without explicitly listing them.

   The structure of the cid value is unspecified.  Its value MUST be a
   case-sensitive string.  Use of this JWP Header Parameter is OPTIONAL.

   The cid can be used similarly to a kid in order to ensure that is it
   possible to externally resolve and then verify that the correct list
   of claim names is being used when processing the payloads containing
   the claim values.

   If there is an associated JWK containing the signing key information,
   the claims key is also registered there as a convenient location for
   the claim names.

   When the claims array is transferred as a property in the Issuer
   Protected Header, any variations of that array between JWP will be
   visible to the verifier, and can leak information about the subject
   or provide an additional vector for linkability.  Given the privacy
   design considerations around linkability, it is RECOMMENDED that the
   claims are defined external to an individual JPT and either
   referenced or known by the application context.

   The following is an example JWP Protected Header that includes a cid:

   {
     "kid": "HjfcpyjuZQ-O8Ye2hQnNbT9RbbnrobptdnExR0DUjU8",
     "alg": "BBS",
     "cid": "guA8PAI14Gkn4273f1rR606yMbRMFg4y"
   }

8.  Presented Claims and Proofs

   Each claim in the issued form of the JPT results in one of three
   things in the presented form of the JPT: 1.  A disclosed JSON value.
   1.  An indicator that the value was not disclosed. 1.  An algorithm-
   specific proof method.

8.1.  Disclosed

   A disclosed payload is represented as a UTF-encoded octet string
   representing a valid JSON value.

8.2.  Undisclosed

   The placeholder indicating that a payload was not disclosed is
   represented as described in Section 6 (Serializations) of
   [I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-proof].

8.3.  Proof Methods

   Proof methods can be returned instead of a disclosed payload.  These
   are generated in an algorithm-specific manner from information in the
   JWP's proof value.

   A proof method may be custom based on the capabilities of the
   algorithm.
